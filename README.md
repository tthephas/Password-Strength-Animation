# Password-Strength-Animation

User can see the image in back become less blurry as their password gets "stronger"

Right now, stronger only has to do with length

Can add filters to get special characters, upper/lower casing on letters, numbers, etc to judge strength

Can be any user/pass page on a website if needed

HTML, CSS, JS
